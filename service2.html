                        an exciting cruise vacation and land tour that allows you to experience all 
                        that your vacation destination has to offer. You'll get a unique vacation 
                        package including a cruise voyage, land-based lodging, and rail or luxury 
                        motor coach travel all in one itinerary.

                        <p> A Cruise Tour will allow you to visit the ports of call that are a 
                            part of your cruise itinerary AND the towns/cities/sights which are 
                            located inland. Cruise lines have streamlined their product so that 
                            you pay just one price, which includes both the cruise and the land 
                            arrangements (hotel stay, sightseeing and transportation). It is, 
                            essentially, the best of both worlds.</p>
