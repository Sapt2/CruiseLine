                   <p><h2>On most cruise lines, the onboard currency is the US Dollar. At the time of boarding the ship, cruise lines take a deposit from their guests, which can be paid in cash or by credit card. Most cruise lines, give each guest a "cruise credit card" at embarkation. This card is both identification and a credit card and can be used for any on-board expenses for example, shore excursions, spa treatments, room service etc. At the end of the cruise, you will check out of your cabin and if there is an amount due back to you, it will be refunded on the spot. Any excess amount can be paid in cash or credit card. The system is fairly similar to the one used by modern hotels.
